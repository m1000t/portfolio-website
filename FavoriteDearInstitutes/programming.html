<h1 class = "Titles">Constants/Variables </h1>
      <h2 class = "subtitles">What they are? </h2>
      <p class = "paragraph">Variables are values that programmers can modify at any time. This is significant because it enables dynamic programming that can instantly react to human input.<br> There are four different sorts of variables: floats (decimal numbers), ints (whole numbers), Boolean (which can only be true or false), and strings (a series of characters). <br>However, a constant is a piece of data whose value is fixed throughout the duration of the program. As a result, the value is constant, just as its name suggests.</p>
      
    <h2 class = "subtitles1">Const statement</h2>
      <p class = "paragraph1">In this const statement is set so that the player's health doesn't exceed 100

I used this const statement in an if statement so if the user has full health the console will tell the user his health is already full this is a perfect way of using const and an if statement together.</p>
      <img src = "assest/carbon (2).svg" class = "const2">
<h2 class = "subtitles2">Let statement</h2>

<p class = "paragraph2">I used this variable to declare the player's health and used it in array functions I used it so if the player's health is greater than 0 it keeps playing but if the player's health is 0 the game finishes.</p>

    <h1 class = "Titles1">Conditional Statements (if statements) </h1>
      <h2 class = "subtitles3">What they are? </h2>
      <p class = "paragraph3">When a condition is true or false, a conditional statement instructs a computer to take a certain action. If-then or if-then-else statements are frequently used to describe it.</p>
      <h2 class = "subtitles4">If and else statement</h2>
    
      <img src = "assest/carbon (5).svg" class = "const5">
        <p class = "paragraph4">During this assessment, I used most of the if loops for error checking and in this specific scenario, I used if and else statements together.<br> The code initially determines if a randomly generated value is smaller than the current weapon's accuracy.<br> The "Hit!" message is logged and the kills number and current points are both increased by 10 if the check is successful. Then next I determine if the current weapon is an RPG or a grenade, <br>or whether a random number is less than 0.5. If the check is successful,it chooses a random item from the PERK ITEMS array and then checks if adding the points of the selected item to the current points exceeds the maximum allowed points. If it does, it sets the current points to the maximum allowed points. Otherwise, it adds the points of the selected item to the current points.

      <h1 class = "Titles1">Repetition Structures (for/while loops)</h1>
          <h2 class = "subtitles5">What is a for and while loop:</h2>
      <p class = "paragraph5">Programming loops repeat a section of code a predetermined number of times until the intended operation is finished.
<br>
There are two types of loops, For loops are used to repeat a specific block of code multiple times and loops are used to repeat until a condition is met. <br>In the screenshot below I used for loop to print the options of the menu on the screen so that first, it locates the type of weapon and the amount of ammo for each weapon. <br> It also shows that when you buy ammo the ammo is added to the original ammo.

        <img src ="assest/carbon (7).svg" class = "const7">
        <p class = "paragraph6">I used this since if the user does not enter anything it will break using the if statement but if the user wants they can enter as many names as he wants.</p>

      <h2 class = "subtitles5">What is a built-in Function:</h2>
      <p class = "paragraph7">Built-in For user convenience, JavaScript developers have built functions inside the coding language. These may be employed to modify strings, produce random numbers, and more. I demonstrate two JavaScript methods below:</p>

      <h2 class ="subtitles7">Example:</h2>
      
      <p class = "paragraph8">I used Math. Random to generate numbers between 1-10 and in assessment 2 for the JavaScript story I created a question where when press enter it generates a number and if the number is higher than 6 you pass.</p>

 <h1 class = "Titles">Custom Functions</h1>
<h2 class ="subtitles9">What is a Custom function: </h2>
    <p class = "paragraph3">The user develops and uses custom functions, which are highly adaptable, repeatedly throughout their code. A custom function can include whatever you choose, and the code within will only run when you call it. <br> They may be set up as follows: <br>
This is a function I made to print out stuff to the console the other one is to clear the terminal and I created the last of to emptyTerminalLine I can call these custom functions during the code for many tasks such as when I want to print something I can just type log instead of the entire thing.</p>

   <h1 class = "Titles">Arrow Functions</h1>
 <h2 class ="subtitles9">What is an Arrow function: </h2>
  <p class = "paragraph3">The function notation is shortened by using arrow functions, a variation on custom functions. With this, a function may be reduced from five to ten lines to just one. They may be organized as follows:
  </p>
  <h2 class = "subtitles10">They may be organized as follows:</h2>
  <img src ="assest/carbon (11).svg" class = "const11">
  <p class = "paragraph9">This is an example of how a comparison of arrow functions and a normal function:

the first one is a normal function: 

In a normal function, the word "arguments" refers to a list of the parameters that were supplied into the function. Regular functions require you to return any value at all times, whereas Arrow functions allow you to omit the return keyword and write in a single line.</p>

      <h1 class = "Titles">Function Documentation</h1>
      <h2 class = "subtitles11">What is function Documentation:</h2>
      <p class = "paragraph10">A document's goal is to make it easier for its creator and readers to share information. Here is an example of how I used it in my code:</p>
<img src ="assest/carbon (13).svg" class ="const13">
      
<p class = "paragraph11">I explained what the parameter is (float, number or void) then explained what the specific variable does and how the function works.</p>

      <h1 class = "Titles4">Arrays</h1>
      <h2 class = "subtitles11">What is an array:</h2>
      <p class = "paragraph12">An array is just a list of items stored in a variable there are many ways arrays can be used such as storing names holding items, or similar situations where you might need to store a list of items in an array.<br>0666666666666666664636 Here is an example of an array I used: </p>
<img src ="assest/carbon (14).svg" class ="const13">
      
<p class = "paragraph13">This is an array that has JavaScript objects meaning that the array has objects which have more values for e.g.: the pistol has accuracy and ammo specifically for the type of weapon.</p>

      <h1 class = "Titles">Modifying Arrays</h1>
      <h2 class = "subtitles11">What Does modifying arrays Mean:</h2>
      <p class = "paragraph12">Modifying an array means Adding or removing items from the array is another type of alteration, as is altering the values of the objects inside the array. </p>
       <br>
       <p class = "paragraph14">An example of modifying an array in my code would be :</p>
<img src ="assest/carbon (15).svg" class ="const13">
      
<p class = "paragraph13">I used to push the names the user enter into an  array then later in the code show it in the menu <br>for e.g. the user enters 30 names all those 30 names get pushed into the array and then I log the array which shows the 30 names </p>
