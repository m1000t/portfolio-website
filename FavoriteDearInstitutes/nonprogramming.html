              During this hardware assignment, I learned about the hardware of
              computers. when doing this project we were supposed to research to
              create a step-by-step list (think 20-30 steps, including the
              computer components). This meant that I had to learn about my
              topic which was (Steps following ) and make an HTML and CSS page.
            </p>

            <p class = "noprogrammingparagraph">
              This project taught me a lot about how a computer works and how
              each component connects with the other, for e.g. connecting the
              Mouse -? -? -? - Solid State Drive. When I was researching this
              topic I learnt about in-depth on each component like the mouse I
              learnt that the mouse has something called the CMOS sensor which
              helps the mouse cursor move around and also something called a USB
              that goes into the motherboard which connects the mouse to the
              motherboard. I also learnt about something called an interrupt,
              the interrupt basically a way to tell the computer that an event
              needs to be processed. Then I learnt about HZ, The screen Hz also
              allows you to see the mouse smoother the higher the Hz the
              smoother the movement. I also learned about mouse triggers and how
              because of something called bus which basically helps the mouse
              communicate around the computer. After this, I learned about the
              three key steps so that the CPU can process the events in the
              computer (Fetch, decode and execute) an example of this would be
              how the CPU gets data from the motherboard and decodes the process
              and then executes the mouse click. I was learning a lot more about
              SSD and HDD as I already knew a bit about them but didn't go
              in-depth so during this assignment I researched more about them
              which taught me how the SSD communicates with the ram and how the
              data gets transferred to the HDD when you save a file on your
              computer.
            </p>
            <p class = "noprogrammingparagraph">
              If there are a few things I would want to learn I would try to
              learn and get more in-depth on each component such as the ram and
              rom I feel like I just touched the top of the iceberg and I still
              have a lot to learn about I want to learn about how the ram is
              able to send the data fast enough and is able to store the data.
              Another thing I want to learn more in-depth is how people save
              data on their computers and how the computer reacts to the save
              button click.
            </p>

            <p class = "noprogrammingparagraph">
            When I was doing this assignment I had some idea of how components related before this project, but not fully how. I discovered how they interacted after doing the necessary research to complete my task in accordance with the guidelines. Additionally, I gained more knowledge about parts like RAM and ROM. Moreover, I gained a deeper understanding of how the CPU interacts with the components. During this Hardware assignment I was researching about a lot about CPUs because I genuinely was trying to learn about them and understand how they work with other parts in the computer, I also improve my knowledge on the computers system. This hardware project most likely increased mine understanding of computer components by giving you hands-on experience studying and learning about individual elements, such as a mouse and SSD (Solid State Drive), and how they interact with other components inside the computer system. For example, I have learnt about the many types of mouse accessible, such as wired and wireless, as well as their features and capabilities. I also have learnt about the many components that make up a mouse, such as the sensors, buttons, and scroll wheel, and how they operate together to deliver input to the computer.
            </p>
            <h2 class = "h2">Q3</h2>
            <p class = "noprogrammingparagraph">
              For new students coming into this course and facing a similar hardware project, my advice would be to research extensively and take detailed notes to establish a strong foundation of knowledge. Before starting the project, take the time to learn about various computer components that will be covered in the project. As you research and learn about the components, make sure to take detailed notes that you can refer back to later. Additionally, don't hesitate to ask your instructor or classmates for help if you have any questions or are unsure about a specific component or aspect of the project. Hands-on practice with a computer or doing any physical activity related to the project will also help you to understand it more effectively. To stay on track and make sure that you are including all of the necessary information in your final project, keep all of your research and notes organized and in one place. Remember that it's okay to make mistakes and that you will learn from them. Take the time to reflect on what you did wrong and figure out how to improve for the next time. Overall, the key to success in this project is to stay organized, stay informed, ask questions, practice hands-on and be open to learning from your mistakes.

Thanks to this Project, I was able to learn more about Industrial Robotics, a growing field of computer science. I was able to learn about the main areas of interest in the field, its recent and potential future growth, the employment available in the sector such as robotics engineering and software engineer, its benefits such as the high pay and future development, and the qualifications required for these positions such as the universities and colleges, which allowed me to figure out another field I could go into and also helped me with university decisions and subjects to aim for. I learned about the trends in this business and whether or not it is increasing. However, I still have a lot to learn. For example, I don't know much about professions in the field; for my project, I just paid attention to two jobs: robotic engineering and software engineering. I learned about what universities and colleges to go to achieve these jobs and also the pay for the jobs.            </p>

In the next 5-10 years, the field of industrial robotics is expected to continue its rapid growth and development, with new jobs and technologies emerging, and some traditional jobs becoming obsolete. I as a student who has recently completed an industrial robotics assignment, it is important to be aware of these changes and take steps to prepare for the future workforce. One way to prepare is to stay informed about the latest trends, certificates and developments in the field by reading industry publications and attending conferences and networking events. Additionally, continuously developing your skills and knowledge in areas such as learning new programming languages (like python, rust and Go) some languages like this may prepare me for a change like rust is basically another replacement of C++ and is considered to be as fast and good as C++ python is easy to learn the language and will help me since a lot of companies are switching to python, software engineering, and control systems will increase your employability. Researching the different job roles available within the industry, such as robotic engineer, software engineer, and automation technician, as well as the qualifications and skills required for these roles and researching the universities and colleges that offer relevant programs in industrial robotics will help you to make informed decisions about your career path.            </p>

From this assignment on AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), I have gained a better understanding of the current state of research and development in the field of AGI. I have learned about the different approaches being taken to create AGI, such as symbolic reasoning, which is based on formal logic and rule-based systems and neural networks, which are based on the structure and function of the human brain. I have also learned about the potential benefits and challenges of AGI, such as its ability to solve complex problems and its potential to revolutionize industries such as healthcare, finance and transportation. On the other hand, I have also learned about the potential negative consequences of AGI, such as job displacement and the potential for misuse. I also learnt about the benefits of AGI on the society some are negative and some are positive</p>
<p class = "noprogrammingparagraph">However, I still have a lot to learn about this subject. For example, I am not completely aware with the technical and mathematical elements of AGI creation, and I would like to obtain a better grasp of the precise algorithms and methodologies utilised in AGI research. Furthermore, I have barely scratched the surface of AGI's ethical and social ramifications. It is critical to understand the larger impact of AGI on society, such as its potential to aggravate socioeconomic inequities, and how to prevent any bad implications. Furthermore, I'd want to understand more about AGI governance and legislation, as well as the possibility of international collaboration in this sector.</p>
            <p class = "noprogrammingparagraph">Overall, while this assignment taught me a lot about AGI, there is still a lot more to learn and explore in this intriguing and fast expanding topic. To be current and relevant in the field of AGI, ongoing learning and modification are required. It is critical to be educated and up to speed on the newest advances, as well as to continually improve your abilities and expertise in the industry.</p>

              If AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) were fully realized today, it would have a significant impact on society and the way we live our lives. AGI would have the ability to solve complex problems that are currently beyond human capabilities, such as understanding the human genome or predicting the weather. Additionally, AGI would be able to work tirelessly and with a high level of accuracy, which would improve efficiency in a wide range of industries, such as manufacturing and transportation. However, AGI would also have the ability to perform a wide range of tasks that are currently done by humans, which could lead to job displacement, particularly in fields such as data entry and customer service. On the other hand, AGI would have the ability to learn and adapt quickly, which could be used to augment human capabilities, such as in medicine or education, and create new jobs that are currently not existent. Furthermore, AGI would raise a number of ethical and societal issues, such as concerns about privacy and security, and the potential for misuse. Overall, the impact of AGI would be far-reaching and it's important to consider these potential changes and to develop responsible policies and regulations to ensure that the benefits of AGI are maximized while minimizing any negative impacts.

            <p class = "noprogrammingparagraph">
            Explaining AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) to people from 1000 years ago would be a challenging task, as it relies on advanced technology and mathematical concepts that would be difficult for them to understand. I would try to explain it by using relatable examples such as a machine that can understand and respond to human speech, or a machine that can make decisions on its own. Additionally, I would use analogies or comparisons to things they would already be familiar with, such as a highly advanced form of a puppet or automaton. I would try to convey the basic concept and potential benefits of AGI in a way that they could understand and relate to, but it would be difficult to fully explain the complexity of AGI to them.

            <p class = "noprogrammingparagraphQ1">Why would you use constants and variables in your code?</p>
             <p class = "noprogrammingparagraph">An example of when you would use constants in your code would be if you were writing a physics simulation and needed to use the value of gravity in multiple places in your code. Instead of hard-coding the value of gravity in each location, you could use a constant to store the value and refer to it throughout your code. </p>
            <p class = "noprogrammingparagraph"> An example of when you would use variables in your code would be if you were writing a program that calculates the area of a rectangle, you would use variables to store the length and width of the rectangle, and then use those variables to perform the calculation.</p>
            <h2 class = "h2">If statements</h2>
            <p class = "noprogrammingparagraphQ1">Why would you choose to use if statements in your code?</p>
            <p class = "nonprogrammingparagraph">If statements are used in code to make decisions and control the flow of the program based on certain conditions. They allow you to check if a certain condition is true, and if it is, execute a block of code. If the condition is not true, the program will skip the block of code and continue executing the rest of the program.</p>
            <p class = "nonprogrammingparagraph">An example of when you would use an if statement in your code would be if you were writing a program that takes user input and only performs an action if the input is within a certain range. You would use an if statement to check if the input is within the desired range, and if it is, execute the action.</p>
            <br>
            <h2 class = "h2">Loops</h2>
            <p class = "noprogrammingparagraphQ1">How might you include loops in your code?</p>
            <br>
            <p class = "nonprogrammingparagraph">An example of when you would use a loop in your code would be if you were writing a program that reads a large amount of data from a file and needs to process each line of data. You would use a for loop to iterate over each line of data in the file and perform the necessary processing for each line.</p>
            <p class = "nonprogrammingparagraph">Another example would be if you were writing a program that prompts the user for input multiple times, you would use a while loop to continue prompting the user for input until they provide the correct input or meet a certain condition.</p>

             <h2 class = "h2">Functions</h2>
            <p class = "noprogrammingparagraphQ1">Why would you need a function in your code?</p>
            <br>
            <p class = "nonprogrammingparagraph">You would need functions need in your code if your want your code to be , well-organized, maintainable, and reusable code. As they allow you to break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks of code, making it easier to understand, debug, and test your program.</p>

       <h2 class = "h2">Arrays</h2>
<p class = "noprogrammingparagraphQ1">Why would you create an array? </p>
            <br>
            <p class = "nonprogrammingparagraph">I might create an array to hold data as an array is a data structure that stores a collection of items of the same data type. as they are used to store multiple values in a single variable and are useful for organizing and storing data efficiently. Arrays allow you to store items in a specific order, iterate over the items using loops, and perform mathematical operations on the data stored in the array. They are a fundamental data structure that is widely used in programming and mathematical applications.</p>
